Hey, I’m Haonan Jiang. The student number is s3652190, email: s3652190@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from Beijing, China, and I can speak Mandarin and English. I attended high school at the Peninsula school in Melbourne from 2013 to 2016, and I have been studying at RMIT since 2017. My hobby is playing basketball, and I like to spend my free time drinking tea. In Melbourne, I have a cat as my pet. Below is a photo of myself and my pet:

# Interest in IT
I have a very strong interest in IT. In high school, I got in touch with some IT-related knowledge and can write some programs to solve mathematical problems. I really enjoy the sense of accomplishment I get after writing each program. RMIT is a very famous school in Melbourne, especially in IT. I hope to get better promotion in IT, so I choose RMIT as my undergraduate and master's school. I hope to learn about algorithms, network security, and front-end related technologies here.

# Ideal Job
The following link shows the career I hope to do: https://www.seek.com.au/job/51780705?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=739b354b-f564-4fb3-850d-8e234c2a8306. I hope to be a cyber security-related engineer. This position requires familiarity with network-related protocols, linux and windows system vulnerabilities inspection and repair, cryptography and encryption protocols, etc. I have now learned the relevant knowledge of network protocols, some encryption and decryption algorithms, and the use of python, java and other languages to implement related programs, or use cisco, wireshark and other software to simulate and analyze the network. The skills I still need to learn are operating system-related knowledge, such as the establishment of security baselines and firewall knowledge. Regarding the acquisition of work experience, in addition to self-study of basic knowledge related to network security. I will try to configure the local system by myself, match the system security baseline, configure the network protocol, and conduct a penetration test on the system, trying to find and fix the system vulnerabilities and network protocol vulnerabilities.

# Personal Profile:
The following is the result by Myers-Briggs test:
 
The test results show that I am suitable to be an advocate. Usually this is the initiator of a project, but it does not mean that I must be a leader. I hope I can do anything right in the project, even things outside of personal work, such as relationship communication between members, help from others in work, and discussions on plans and technologies, etc. In addition to technical matters, I may pay more attention to maintaining the relationship between members and being an initiator of communication.

# Project Idea
## Overview: 
I plan to develop a smart phone app in this project. The theme of the app can be online real estate rental software or restaurant menu ordering software. It can develop related functions in line with the current COVID-19 epidemic situation.
## Motivation: 
Although the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia is getting better now, we still need to pay attention to avoid the repeated expansion of the epidemic. Therefore, mobile application development is our best choice. First of all, we can learn the distribution of the epidemic remotely and avoid activities in severely epidemic areas; secondly, according to the principle of no contact during the epidemic, the convenience of mobile phones allows us to easily control what we need to do remotely. And mobile phone users can also avoid large-scale gatherings at the same time.
## Description: 
Suppose we choose to develop a restaurant menu ordering application. First of all, we need to design the user registration/login interface. We need to obtain the user’s basic information, such as name, phone number, address, etc. If we need to design the online payment function, we also need to obtain the user’s bank card, etc. This process may not be fully implemented. Need to obtain the relevant API functions of the bank. In addition, we also need to design the login interface of the restaurant. The restaurant can edit its own address, business hours, contact number, current number of people, maximum number of people and other information. Restaurants can also use the app to modify their daily menus, dishes prices, etc. For restaurants, we need to display the address of the restaurant (may use Google map API), we can also display the restaurant table layout, the number of people dining, the number of people in line and other information, for those users who want to avoid contact with too many people. It can also display the introduction of the restaurant, today's special dishes and other news. In terms of menus, we need to classify dishes according to different flavors. If the application is used for a long time, we can first sort according to the total number of orders of customers. For those users who frequent a certain restaurant, we can sort them according to his Personal preference to make recommendations. At the same time, we can design a scoring system for the restaurant and each dish, and customers can rate them or leave a message, so that the restaurant can make improvements based on the data provided by our app. If necessary, we can also design a real-time communication interface between the restaurant and the user, used for the communication of problems arising during the meal, or simply implement a function of calling the waiter. If the application is for multiple restaurants, we also need to sort the restaurants. The specific sort index can be the current distance, score, business hours and service rank, etc. 
## Hardware requirements: 
Two mobile phones, one can simulate a restaurant and the other can simulate a user; a computer as a back-end server for storing application back-end programs and application databases, etc.
## Software or technical requirements: 
MIT App Inventor, used for application interface design; development languages such as java or python, used for background programs and API interface design; database applications, SQLite and other database software libraries, you can use python and other code to control the database and store it User information, etc.; application of encryption technology, user personal information encryption, password encryption, etc., algorithms such as RSA can be used.
## Skill requirements: 
The application design requires a sufficient understanding of application development and proficient use of related languages (java, python, etc.). At the same time, you must have sufficient knowledge of APIs, and you can design APIs independently or apply API functions of other software (Google Map API, etc.). With sufficient knowledge of database design, you can easily get started with database engines such as SQLite. At the same time, relevant encryption technologies or algorithms can be used to encrypt those private data.
## Outcome: 
The mobile application needs to realize the restaurant ordering function, which can provide users who are concerned about the epidemic situation with effective restaurant choices during the COVID-19 period. At the same time, it can also obtain the restaurant's business conditions, safety ratings, etc. in advance. If the application is helpful for this, it can prove that the current life trend is developing towards convenient and real-time mobile phone applications.
